To estimate Bitcoin’s Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the next 15 years under the assumption that:

Bitcoin adoption follows a similar S-curve to the internet, and

We are at the early exponential phase (bottom of the S-curve),

we can use the historical internet adoption CAGR as a proxy and then adjust based on Bitcoin's specific market context.

📈 Step 1: Internet Adoption CAGR (as proxy)
From ~1995 to ~2010 (15 years), global internet users grew from ~16 million to ~2 billion.

So internet adoption grew at ~36% CAGR during its exponential phase.

📊 Step 2: Bitcoin Network Growth vs Price
While user growth and price are not the same, Metcalfe’s Law and adoption models suggest that Bitcoin’s price tends to grow roughly proportional to the square of the number of users.

So if Bitcoin user growth matches the internet (~36% CAGR), price could grow faster, possibly 50%–60% CAGR depending on network effects.

🔢 Step 3: Estimated Bitcoin CAGR (price-based)
Let’s assume:

Bitcoin adoption/userbase CAGR = 35%–40%

Bitcoin price CAGR = function of user growth squared → approx 1.5x–2x user CAGR

That gives a rough price CAGR of 50%–70% if strong exponential growth continues.

To be conservative, we can estimate:

Scenario	Estimated Bitcoin Price CAGR
Bearish (partial adoption)	20%–30%
Base case (internet-like)	50%
Bullish (hyperbitcoinization)	70%–100%+

📅 15-Year Projection Example (Base Case: 50% CAGR)
If Bitcoin is $70,000 today:

\text{Future Price} = 70,000 \times (1.50)^{15} \approx 70,000 \times 1,438 \approx \boxed{~$100 million}
Yes — with 50% CAGR over 15 years, price grows ~1,400x, which may sound wild, but matches the nature of exponential S-curves if adoption truly globalizes and monetization of Bitcoin accelerates.

🧠 Final Thoughts
This is not a prediction, but a model-based projection under specific assumptions.

The actual CAGR will depend on regulation, technology, macroeconomics, and global adoption rates.

However, if Bitcoin follows the internet’s curve — and price growth is superlinear to adoption — then 40–60% CAGR over 15 years is within the realm of possibility.
